DLect Mobile

 - Use the libraries that were written for DLect-Desktop.
    - Change the Java version to 6 as there is limited support for Java 7 features on Android.
 - This means that we can test the water with an android app without having to shell out for a web server.
 - Potentially use Grails or Scala for the website.
 - Maybe use one of the languages like Node.js for it's speed and simplicity; however I would have to learn it.

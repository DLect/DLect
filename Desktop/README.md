This project was coined because I was fed-up with manually downloading each of
    my lecture recordings manually, Then forgetting which lectures they were.
    Now it has become larger and better than I could have ever imagined.

Version 2.0
-----------

So much simpler than ever before and it has support for other universities(Griffith University I'm looking at you).

Note that with this version, the files are downloaded into the same folder as the `DLect.jar` file.

Version 1.5
-----------

Just enter your Blackboard Login information, choose your courses, then lectures and it downloads them.

NOTES:
------

###SECURITY###

The properties file(including your username and password) is `lightly` encrypted to prevent anybody without a significant knowledge of Java for finding it. However it is still possible to unlock the username and password.

###UPLOAD###
The program uploads start-up times along with OS, Java and DLect Versions.

###AUTO-UPDATER###

The application(from version 1.5pre16) includes an auto updater. This means that it will upload the current version number to the server. This information is not saved nor recorded, and is used purely by the application to determine if there are updates avaliable.

Ensure that downloads go into their subject's folder. 

Ensure that the folder is not created until the download is started.

Add a Try Again/Refresh button to both SubjectPane and the SubjectListingPanel

Add a button to restart DLect when an update is detected. 
 \ Maybe force the Updater window to show.
 
Add a Report Error button to error dialogs.
 \ Maybe add one to the main panel/login panel for other errors.
 \ Would need to implement something to allow the reports to be stored with additional information such as the user's description ect.
